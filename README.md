# auth-web-service

This is a web service that allows registering new users, signing in users, and accessing users' information. It uses authentication tokens and stores user information in a Mongo database. It was my submission for an assignment in CS 480W: Programming for the Web at Binghamton University in fall 2017. For more details, see the assignment document.
